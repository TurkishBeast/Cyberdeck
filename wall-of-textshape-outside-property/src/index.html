Its beady black eyes hold secrets of bathtime lore, and its squeak? Oh, that squeak is the anthem of chaos itself, a symphony of playful absurdity. It bobs up and down, defying gravity and logic, a plastic enigma in a frothy sea, daring you to question its purpose. Is it just a toy? Or a philosopher disguised as bathroom decor? Some say rubber duckies are spies from the aquatic underworld, plotting to overthrow soap dishes everywhere. Others believe they’re interdimensional beings, slipping between realms to bring whimsy to the mundane.
