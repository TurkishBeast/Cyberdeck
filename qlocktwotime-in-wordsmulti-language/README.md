This is my attempt to create the QLOCKTWO for the web.

About the functionality: 
The QLOCKTWO enables a very accurate time reading. In addition to the written time, you have to add the dots that light up at the edge to the time announcement. Especially for the web version, I have added a seconds display at the bottom.

You can make various settings over the menu. The language can be changed manually. You can also change colours and textures.

Languages currently available: EN, DE, FR, IT and ES
